# PRODIGY_ML_04
Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship - Task 04
Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a hand gesture recognition system capable of identifying and classifying different hand gestures from image data, enabling gesture-based human–computer interaction.

Dataset

Instead of using the provided dataset, a custom hand gesture dataset was created and used for this project. The images were manually collected and organized into gesture categories for training and evaluation of the model.

Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Methodology

* Image data collection and preprocessing
* Dataset labeling and organization
* Model training using deep learning techniques
* Gesture classification and prediction

Outcome

The trained model successfully recognizes different hand gestures from input images, demonstrating the application of machine learning in real-time interaction systems.
